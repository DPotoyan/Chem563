## Materials for the course Chem563: Statistical Mechanics, ISU Spring 2020 

**Instructor:** Davit Potoyan

The course content is broken up into (hopefully) self-contained units organized by distinct topics. Inside each directory of a unit you will find the following materials:

1. Lecture slides giving brief summary of key ideas and equation. This is for quick reviewing of discussed material.
2. PDF files of relevant research papers, book chapters and other extra reading material. This is for bedtime reading.  
3. Jupyter-notebooks and some_file1.py  files containing short snippets for doing various numerical experiments.

The two best ways to make use of the resoruces is to: 

- Launch the binder, thereby running the notebooks in the cloud. 
- Download files, create a separate conda environment using enviroanment.yml and run notebooks locally in your computer.
- To render the notebooks in larger and prettier fonts please run the last cell in the notebook.
