E.g Violating Kelvin's statement implies building cyclical process that can extract work from cold bath and use the work to heat up the hot bath thereby increasing its energy. This clearly violates Clausius statement of second law. And vice versa if we violate Clausius statement then we can devise an adiabatic system split into colder and warmer halves and operate a cyclinc engine that keeps on generating work thereby violating Kelvin's statement. \n",
