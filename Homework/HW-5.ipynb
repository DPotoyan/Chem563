    "### Problem 1: Maximum entropy distribution of die rolls with a constraint.\n",
    "We know that in the absence of constraints the probability distirbution of die rolls is uniform, each number shows up with 1/6 probability. <br>\n",
    "(i) What would be the probability distribution of die rolls subject to a constraint that its first moment is fixed at some value $\\mu$. <br>\n",
    "(ii) What would be the probability distribution of die rolls subject to a constraint that its second moment is fixed to $\\sigma^2$. The procedure for deriving porbability distirbution by maximizing the entropy is exactly the same one that we used for deriving Boltzmann distribution. E.g you may take $E_i=i$ for an analogy and think of die values as energy levels.  "
