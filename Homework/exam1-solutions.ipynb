From overall translational degrees we get $E_{trans}\\sim\\frac{3}{2}k_B T$ and from rotations we get:   $E_{rot}\\sim\\frac{3}{2}k_B T$.

    "(iii) Black body radiation problem was about resolving an apparent conflict betweene xperimental predictions and the cutting edge theory of the time, which was: classical mechanics implying equipartition theorem for black body. becasue of equipartion theorem distirbution of frequencies radiating from black body was predicted to diverge in high frequecy regime (ultraviolet catastrophe). This was clearly an unphysical result implying infite energy radiation. Planck resolved the problem by ditching equipartion theorem and bringin in distirbution that is obtained by assuming quantization of energy $P(\\omega)d\\omega \\sim \\frac{\\omega^2d \\omega}{e^{\\beta \\hbar \\omega }-1}$! (see the harmonic oscillator problem). The quantization and existence of energy gaps made the very high frequency modes frozen and inaccesible for thermal excitations. This lead to perfect agreement with experiments. Quantum mechanics was born by combining energy quantization with statistical mechanics reasoning.   \n",
